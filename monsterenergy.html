<h3>Monster Energy Absolutely Zero </h3>
<p>People have been blowin’ up our inbox for years asking for a zero calorie Monster. We got it, but this ain’t soda pop, dude!
Making a zero calorie, zero sugar drink, that’s good enough to earn the Monster M ain’t that easy.
Finally with a re-tooled energy blend, new sweetener system and after hundreds of failed flavors, we absolutely got it right!
Monster Absolutely Zero: helps fight fatigue, improve mental performance and focus, and motivates you to work ( I mean play ) harder, so generally you feel pretty damn good.
Zero calories, zero sugar, Monster buzz…</p>

<h3>Monster Assault Energy </h3>
<p>At Monster we don’t get too hung up on politics. We’re not for “the War”, against “the War” or any war for that matter.
We put the “camo” pattern on our new Monster Assault can because we think it looks cool. Plus it helps fire us up to fight the big multi-national companies who dominate the beverage business.
We’ll leave politics to the politicians and just keep doing what we do best – make the meanest energy drinks on the planet!
Declare war on the ordinary! Grab a Monster Assault and Viva La Revolution!</p>
