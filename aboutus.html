	<p>An energy drink is a type of beverage containing stimulant drugs, usually including caffeine, which is marketed as providing mental and physical stimulation. They may or may not be carbonated and many also contain sugar or other sweeteners, herbal extracts, taurine, and amino acids. They are a subset of the larger group of energy products and distinct from sports drinks, which are advertised to enhance sports performance. There are many brands and varieties of energy drinks.</p>
